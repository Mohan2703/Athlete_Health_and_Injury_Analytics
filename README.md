<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Problem Statement ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

**Problem**

In this Challenge, you will work on Athlete Health & Injury Dataset to help sports organizations minimize downtime, control costs, and enhance player availability through rigorous, data-backed injury management. Doctors, leagues, athletic trainers, and front-office executives - all benefit from granular injury insights to preserve competitive edge and safeguard athlete welfare.

**Challenges:**

- Which types of injuries occur most frequently?
- Which sports or events have the highest rate of injury?
- Are injuries more common in specific athlete age groups or genders?
- How does injury severity vary across different types of sports or positions?
- How long does recovery typically take for various injury types?
- Which treatment methods are most effective for speeding up recovery?
- Do certain coaches or teams have consistently lower injury rates?
- Are there regional differences in injury frequency or severity?
- Does the playing surface or competition level affect injury occurrence?

**Use Case & Main Goal:**

- Tests your ability to model relationships, handle conformed dimensions, and optimize DAX measures.
- Build a portfolio piece that simulates genuine business requirements in a high-stakes, performance-driven sport industry.
- Use-case allows you to craft compelling narratives around player health, financial stewardship, and competitive advantage.

## Project Planning using Star Method

<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View Stratergy ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

- **Understand key KPIs:** Total Engagement, Views, Impressions, Click-Through Rate (CTR), and Engagement Rate.
- **Build hierarchical view:** Platform ‚Üí Content Category ‚Üí Post Type ‚Üí Post-Level Details.
- **Enable drilldowns:** from a high-level overview ‚Üí campaign analysis ‚Üí regional performance ‚Üí content-specific insights.
- **Design dashboards:** clear filters for platform, country, campaign, content type, and date range.

### üìù S - Situation

Sports organizations were struggling to track and analyze athlete health data at scale. Medical staff, coaches, and management faced the following challenges:

- Rising treatment costs without visibility into drivers.

- Lack of insight into injury causes, vulnerable body parts, and recurrence patterns.

- Difficulty measuring treatment effectiveness and coach impact on recovery.

- Limited ability to compare trends regionally, by sport, or by competition level.

**Context:**

- This project is part of the Athlete Health & Injury Analytics challenge, designed to simulate real-world requirements in the high-stakes sports industry. The ultimate goal is to help organizations minimize downtime, control costs, and enhance player availability through data-backed decisions.

### üéØ T - Task

The objective was to design and implement a centralized analytics solution that:

- Consolidates raw data from injury logs, treatments, costs, and player details.

- Provides multi-dimensional insights at player, regional, and organizational levels.

- Enables stakeholders (doctors, trainers, coaches, executives) to explore:

    - Most frequent injury types and affected body parts.

    - Recovery timelines by severity, treatment, and sport.

    - Cost trends (MOM, YOY) across treatments and surfaces.

    - Coach and team effectiveness in reducing recovery times.

    - Regional and demographic (age, gender) variations.

### ‚ö° A - Action

- Collected and cleaned raw data from injury reports, treatment logs, and cost data.

- Designed a data model with fact and dimension tables (injuries, players, treatments, costs, surfaces, coaches).

- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard with drill-downs by sport, injury type, region, and recovery outcomes.

- Used DAX measures for KPIs like treatment success %, YOY cost change, recovery rate, and coach impact.

- Visualized metrics using maps, bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and custom visuals Visuals of Zoom Charts.

### üèÜ R - Result

The analytics solution delivered measurable impact:

- Enhanced visibility into injury distribution and treatment costs across 15 countries.

- Identified top sports and body parts prone to injuries, guiding prevention strategies.

- Highlighted most effective treatments and coaches that reduced recovery times.

- Provided strategic insights to reduce costs, lower recurrence rates, and safeguard athlete welfare.

- Built a portfolio-grade dashboard that demonstrates real-world decision support in sports analytics.

## Data Preprocessing & ETL
<details>
<summary>
$\textsf{\color{blue}{View PreProcssing Steps ‚û°Ô∏è}}$
</summary><br>

The dataset used for this project followed a Star Schema design, with multiple dimension tables (Players, Clubs, Coaches, Injuries, Treatments, Events, Locations) and a central FactInjuries table. To ensure data quality and usability in Power BI, an ETL pipeline was implemented within Power Query.

**Steps Performed**

**1. Data Ingestion**

- Imported the raw dataset from Excel (Challenge_29_Athlete Health & Injury Dataset (Star Schema).xlsx).

- Each worksheet (DimClub, DimCoach, DimPlayer, DimInjuryType, DimTreatment, DimLocation, DimEvent, FactInjuries) was extracted individually using Excel.Workbook() function.

**3. Header Promotion & Schema Alignment**

- Promoted first row to column headers across all tables.

- Renamed columns where needed to maintain consistency.

- Applied appropriate data types (e.g., text for names, integer for keys, date for injury dates, currency for cost values).

**2. Data Cleaning**

- Removed unnecessary columns (like blank index columns sometimes created by Excel exports).

- Handled missing or null values in cost, recovery days, and outcomes with either replacement (0 for numeric, "Unknown" for categorical) or filtering if irrelevant.

- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., "Minor", "Moderate", "Severe" in DimInjuryType ‚Üí ensured consistent casing).

**4. Calendar Table Creation**

- Built a dynamic Calendar Table using:
```
 CALENDAR(MIN(FactInjuries[InjuryDate]), MAX(FactInjuries[InjuryDate])).
```

- Enriched with Year, Quarter, Month, Week, and Day attributes to support time intelligence measures (YOY, MOM).

**5. Fact-Dimension Relationships**

- Ensured referential integrity by matching foreign keys in FactInjuries with dimension primary keys (e.g., PlayerDimKey ‚Üí DimPlayer, ClubDimKey ‚Üí DimClub).

- Verified one-to-many relationships across the schema.

**6.Data Transformation & Derived Columns**

- Created calculated columns for Age Bins (e.g., <20, 20-30, 30+) and Cost Bins for better filtering.

- Applied conditional transformations to derive severity levels, recurrent injury flags, and treatment outcomes.

‚úÖ After ETL, the dataset was clean, typed, and structured in a Star Schema ‚Äî enabling efficient DAX calculations for KPIs such as Total Injuries, Avg Recovery Days, Treatment Success %, YOY/MOM comparisons, and Cost Analysis.
